# AISCULAPIUS
The GitHub repository is an open-source python based AI platform, integrating bioinformatics, molecular simulation, and deep learning to revolutionize novel therapeutic compound discovery, emphasizing multi-target therapy and continuous learning. By connecting platforms like OpenAI’s LLMs (including future specialized models such as ChatGPT-4B for biology and genetic engineering + Operator API), AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, and cutting‑edge molecular docking simulation and data management tools, our system creates a seamless pipeline. It transforms raw data into actionable therapeutic insights—enabling collaborative, open‑source innovation in drug discovery for the betterment of humanity. At the heart of the system is the Advanced Pipeline Orchestrator (or “Core Brain”), which coordinates all modules and data flows. This orchestrator is built on FastAPI and asynchronous Python, enabling background execution, real‑time progress monitoring via WebSockets, and comprehensive error handling. It gathers outputs from each module, aggregates data, and ultimately produces a final report for strategic decision-making. 

First it should use AutoGPT or a GPT Agent to research any specific topic given "How can we improve brain healing from a concusion" then it will reserch a topic group using various sources (Wiki, PubMed, Naturakl Chat GPT Knowledge thought, Topics in this example for reserch should include things a such as  ("mTBI, TBI, Concussions, BDNF, NGF, Neurogenesis, neurotransmitters for memory, how to improve sleep, how to improve neuronal mitochondrial function, how to improve neuronal membrane fluidity, how antioxidants help brain recovery, and all available things that we know improve neurogenesis, Improveing memory, Improving brain) then it should hand this to the next agent, and so on. After we have a GPT Model 4B look into ways to improve current best available options through editing the compounds or proteins and create 1,000 possible alternative novel proteins,    

When Given- "Concussion" = (SEEK) - Brain Damage, Inflammation, Neuron Damage, Mitochondrial Disfunction, Sleep Loss, Memory Problems, Decreased Membrane Fluidity, Decreased Neuronal Membrane Barrier, Healthy Neuron Apoptosis, How to increase Dendrite Density, How to increase brain cell growth. --> Receptor Target (Brain Call Growth) = TrkA (NTRK1), TrkB (NTRK2), TrkC (NTRK3), GFRα1, GFRα2, GFRα3, and GFRα4, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, EGFR, Insulin Receptor (IR), IGF-1 Receptor (IGF-1R), IGF-2 Receptor (IGF-2R), ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, CNTFRα along with co-receptors LIFRβ and gp130, & TGF-β. -->  (Analyze best potential receptors paths that are the most effective for the goal by ranking in GPT, (Trk Receptors) & find all Agonists and inhibitors for the receptor list one group at a time) --> Group: TrkA (NTRK1) -	Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Gambogic Amide, Tavilermide (also known as D3 peptide), Agonistic anti‐TrkA antibodies / Group: TrkB (NTRK2) Brain‐Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin‐4/5 (NT‑4/5), 7,8‑Dihydroxyflavone, LM22A‑4, Deoxygedunin, Agonistic anti‐TrkB antibodies (e.g. 29D7) / Group: TrkC (NTRK3) -	Neurotrophin‑3 (NT‑3) Agonistic anti‐TrkC antibodies. We then query AlphaFold through Operator to retrive the structures of all these compounds and split them into agonists and inhibitors, we will annotate each compound using a LLM in the table to identify Pros & Cons, limitations, and potential imporvments for each. The potential improvments would look like- (Potential Modification Strategies - 1. Improving Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Penetration	- Chemical Modification: Increase lipophilicity or add transporter-recognition motifs. Conjugation: Attach cell-penetrating peptides or use nanocarriers that facilitate transport across the BBB.	2 Enhancing Stability and Half-Life	- PEGylation or Fusion Proteins: Attach polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains or fuse with Fc fragments to slow renal clearance. - Stabilizing Mutations: Engineer point mutations that reduce degradation without compromising activity. 3 Optimizing Receptor Binding Specificity and Efficacy	- Structure-Guided Mutagenesis: Modify ligand binding domains to increase affinity or selectivity for Trk receptors (e.g., by mimicking or enhancing critical contact points). - SAR Studies: Conduct detailed structure–activity relationship studies to fine-tune agonist potency. Minimizing Off-Target Effects - Molecular Fine-Tuning: Modify regions that contribute to binding non-target receptors or unwanted signaling pathways. - Targeted Delivery Systems: Combine the agonist with targeting antibodies or nanoparticles to focus action in injured brain areas.)
 
Once we obtain the amino acid sequences and structural models from AlphaFold servers and UniProt via the Operator API for both agonists and inhibitors—accompanied by an annotated list detailing the pros, cons, and potential improvements for each candidate—the system aggregates all available treatment data and sequences and then forwards this comprehensive dataset to ChatGPT-4B. ChatGPT-4B retains the information in a structured format (for example, “BDNF Amino Acid Sequence (SQSKGNLTKLHLAKSIEDRGFGFNKDGILNNKLGKQDGSVYTSDNTQSSSVKEDSKGFLKKLGNVTANPKLLLSALNQRSQKKAEAKKYKAKALVSTQEAALNTLSNSKGQNSNLENLR), NGF Amino Acid Sequence (FVNITVLSQNPDSHTTVQSKYNFSRVRKAYYKLLEKCDGKKRDCVNTDKSPPVDHACRTVTLSCGEAIVYACQWSSCNVIFGMDSSLSKLSARLDLQGQTSAQTLEIWTDSGVTVYQVDAVLE), NT-3 Amino Acid Sequence (YSVCDSESLWVTDKSSAIDIRGHQVTVLGEIKTGNSPVKQYFYETRCKEARPVKNGCRGIDDKHWNSQCKTSQTYVRALTSENNKLVGWRWIRIRIDTSCVCALSRKIGRTPGRLLEER), etc.”). At this stage, the 4B model is activated to design new, potentially more beneficial amino acid sequences, utilizing FoldSeek to filter out any sequences that are already known or exhibit high similarity to existing proteins. AutoGPT or a similar API-driven automation tool then executes this generation-and-filtering cycle multiple times—ranging from 10 to 1,000 iterations—keeping an internal record of all newly generated sequences and continuously integrating them into the FoldSeek pre-filtering pipeline.

Once a sufficient collection of novel sequences is accumulated, they are sent back through the Operator API for processing via the AlphaFold servers, which produce updated structural predictions and a suite of predictive analyses for each protein candidate. The resulting output files, which contain detailed structural models and associated confidence metrics, serve as inputs for a series of molecular docking simulations. In these simulations, the receptor protein structures, sourced from both AlphaFold and UniProt, are combined with the newly engineered protein models to evaluate their binding interactions. The simulation outputs include specific values such as binding affinity (ΔG₍bind₎) measured in kcal/mol, where more negative values indicate stronger binding; the number and quality of hydrogen bonds, which contribute significantly to binding specificity and stability; shape complementarity between the protein’s binding site and the ligand, ensuring an optimal steric match; and desolvation energy, which accounts for the energetic cost of removing water molecules from the binding interface. Additional metrics include hydrophobic interaction scores reflecting non-polar contacts, root mean square deviation (RMSD) to assess structural similarity between the docked pose and reference structures, electrostatic interaction energy to quantify attractions and repulsions between charged groups, and van der Waals interaction energy that captures dispersion and repulsion forces between atoms in close proximity. Furthermore, if available, toxicity predictions such as LD50 values from toxicology simulations provide critical insights into the potential harmful effects of the protein-ligand complexes. These detailed metrics are then fed into a PyTorch-based machine learning and deep learning model that ranks the protein candidates based on their performance against these key performance indicators, ultimately highlighting the most promising sequences for further development into more effective protein-based therapeutics.

Using the key performance indicators (KPIs) obtained from the molecular docking simulations, the system will identify and rank the top candidates—ranging between five and twenty-five—and then generate a detailed report that explains why each candidate holds promise. For each selected protein, a large language model (LLM) will analyze and articulate the specific pros and cons compared to current available options, drawing on the simulation data such as binding affinity, hydrogen bonding, desolvation energy, and other critical parameters. This detailed explanation will include a comprehensive discussion of the structural, energetic, and interaction characteristics that set the new candidate apart, along with a reasoned account of the design principles and modifications employed during its creation. All of this information will be meticulously stored in an associated table, linking each protein sequence to its respective filtering data and simulation outcomes for easy reference.

Once these top candidates have been evaluated and ranked, the system will forward them to Operator API for reverse translation—a process that converts the protein sequences into their corresponding genetic (nucleotide) sequences. This step, which can be executed using tools such as EMBOSS backtranseq or the Reverse Translate tool available at the Sequence Manipulation Suite, ensures that the nucleotide sequences are optimized based on organism-specific codon usage tables (Humans). The conversion process will be seamlessly executed through the Operator API, guaranteeing that each promising protein candidate is accurately translated into a viable genetic sequence ready for further expression and experimental validation. For each compound, the system automatically generates a comprehensive document that serves as a detailed experimental protocol and educational guide. This document outlines a clear hypothesis for the protein candidate based on the computational data obtained from molecular docking and simulation studies. It explains the rationale behind the candidate’s design and its anticipated benefits over existing proteins, citing specific KPIs such as binding affinity, hydrogen bonding, and other critical interaction metrics. The protocol then details how to develop the protein using CRISPR-based gene editing in fungal models like yeast, including step-by-step instructions for designing guide RNAs, selecting appropriate yeast strains, and optimizing transformation conditions. The document also incorporates safety considerations, troubleshooting guidelines, and quality control measures to ensure successful integration and expression of the target gene in the fungal system.

In addition to the technical protocol, the document is written in an accessible format intended for educational purposes, making it suitable for students and researchers in school laboratories or early-phase trials. It provides a clear outline of the experimental design, including a hypothesis statement, background on the protein’s potential applications, and the expected outcomes of the CRISPR-mediated experiments. The guide emphasizes the connection between computational predictions and real-world experimental validation, offering insights into how molecular docking data informs gene editing strategies and subsequent protein functionality assessments. Overall, this document not only serves as a roadmap for developing and validating the protein candidate but also as a teaching tool that demystifies advanced biotechnological techniques and encourages hands-on learning in modern molecular biology.
