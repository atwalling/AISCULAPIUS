# AISCULAPIUS
The GitHub repository is an open-source python based AI platform, integrating bioinformatics, molecular simulation, and deep learning to revolutionize novel therapeutic compound discovery, emphasizing multi-target therapy and continuous learning. By connecting platforms like OpenAI’s LLMs (including future specialized models such as ChatGPT-4B for biology and genetic engineering + Operator API), AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, and cutting‑edge molecular docking simulation and data management tools, our system creates a seamless pipeline. It transforms raw data into actionable therapeutic insights—enabling collaborative, open‑source innovation in drug discovery for the betterment of humanity. At the heart of the system is the Advanced Pipeline Orchestrator (or “Core Brain”), which coordinates all modules and data flows. This orchestrator is built on FastAPI and asynchronous Python, enabling background execution, real‑time progress monitoring via WebSockets, and comprehensive error handling. It gathers outputs from each module, aggregates data, and ultimately produces a final report for strategic decision-making.

## Overview

The **Drug Discovery Pipeline Orchestrator** is an open‑source, revolutionary platform designed to accelerate and transform drug discovery. By integrating state‑of‑the‑art techniques in artificial intelligence, molecular simulation, bioinformatics, and continuous learning, the system enables the discovery and optimization of novel therapeutic candidates for complex, multi-target diseases.

This platform is built to address challenges such as multi-receptor targeting and combination therapy design, ensuring that new treatments are both effective and safe. It is designed for both end‑user interaction and deep administrative analysis, promoting global collaboration among institutions such as MIT, Harvard, CalTech, Stanford, Google, and more.

  A modern web-based UX/UI built using FastAPI, WebSockets, and Jinja2 offers real-time progress updates, interactive dashboards, and comprehensive reporting.

- **Open Collaboration & Security:**  
  The system integrates with GitHub for open-source sharing and collaboration, while robust security, compliance, and privacy modules ensure data protection and auditability.

- **Automated PubMed Integration:**  
  A dedicated module continuously fetches, processes, and memorizes new PubMed articles, ensuring that the system remains updated with the latest research findings.

- **Administrative Meta-Analysis:**  
  Deep analytical tools provide strategic insights through Pareto analysis, multi-objective optimization, and expert summarization (via ChatGPT), accessible only to administrators.
